# NASA_Mars_Photo_App

The NASA Mars Photo App utilizes the NASA API, enabling users to select one of the Mars rovers and view available photos. Users can choose a photo, which will then be displayed. After closing the photo, the app will return to the menu, allowing users to either view another photo or go back to the main menu, where they can exit the application.
